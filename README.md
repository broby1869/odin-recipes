Brutalistic html page
A recipe website project testing html
I created a home page with links to different recipes 
for a nice chicken dinner.
I utilized: 
    the git commands I've learned.
    the img and anchor commands I've learned
    and hosted the images I found on imgur.com

Great exercise to solidify what we've covered so far.
